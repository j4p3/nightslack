nightslack
==========

Based on work from [Slack Night Mode](https://github.com/laCour/slack-night-mode) users.

Should work if you download and run the script. Quitting or updating slack will require you to run it again.

Theme pulled from https://github.com/j4p3/slack-themes/, feel free to use your own. This one doesn't support code blocks too well.
